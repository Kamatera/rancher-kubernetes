# Pipelines

Rancher includes pipelines integration which allows simple CI/CD based on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repositories

Add pipeline repositories from cluster -> resources -> pipelines

The repository needs to contain a `rancher-pipeline.yml` file which configures the build steps

See [Pipeline Configuration Reference](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/pipelines/config/) for details
